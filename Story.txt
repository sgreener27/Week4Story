It was fall of 1998 when Ferdinand happened upon the map. He was walking down the busy street back towards his apartment building
and decided to take a shortcut down a nearby alleyway to avoid the crowds. The alley was empty save for a few stray cats, but a piece of paper snagged on 
the trash can caught his eye. He walked over to it and detached it from where it was stuck . It was old, worn, and barely legible, but defintely a map. 
Normally, he would've left it at that and simply thrown in into the dumpster- he wasn't a curious type unless absolutely necessary- and this situation waranted no
necessitity. Or it didn't until three men dressed as if they were from 2 centuries prior rounded the corner, spotted him, and ran towards him with swords drawn.
