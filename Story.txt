  It was fall of 1998 when Randy happened upon the map. He was walking down the busy street back towards his apartment building
and decided to take a shortcut down a nearby alleyway to avoid the crowds. The alley was empty save for a few stray cats, but a piece of paper snagged on 
the trash can caught his eye. He walked over to it and detached it from where it was stuck . It was old, worn, and barely legible, but defintely a map. 
Normally, he would've left it at that and simply thrown in into the dumpster- he wasn't a curious type unless absolutely necessary- and this situation waranted no
necessitity. Or it didn't until three men dressed as if they were from 2 centuries prior rounded the corner, spotted him, and ran towards him with swords drawn.
  Randy clutched the map in his hand and ran. He took a couple turns down some side streets and lost them. He saw them stop at the intersection he just ran
through, look in all directions, and decide to run down a different street. He made it back to his apartment, locked the doors, checked his windows, and, finally
feeling safe, look at the map he had found. He was shocked when he looked down and saw the map led straight to his apartment. There was a big "X" on his building 
and his apartment nummber was circled in the top right corner. Feeling like someone was looking over his shoulder, he walked through his whole apartment again
and turned all the lights on, checking every closet and every room. Luckily it was a small apartment. He looked at the street through his window, but immediately
ducked out of sight. The guys with the swords were back. And they were looking right at him.
